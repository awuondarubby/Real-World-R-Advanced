# Real-World R Practice: freeCodeCamp Course Walkthrough

This repository contains my hands-on practice and notes from the [freeCodeCamp R for Data Science full course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V8eKsto3Ug). I followed the entire video tutorial and coded along while organizing and testing each section in R.

## What This Project Covers

This project walks through core R programming concepts and packages with real examples. Topics include:

- Data types and structures (vectors, matrices, data frames, lists, factors)
- Basic data visualization (plot, barplot, histograms, scatterplots)
- Package management using `pacman`
- Importing data (`readr`, `rio`, `readxl`, `read.csv`, etc.)
- Exploratory Data Analysis with base R and the `psych` package
- Data cleaning and manipulation
- Modeling basics: regression, clustering, and PCA
- Using `summary()`, `describe()`, and subsetting techniques

## File

- `practice_freecodecamp_video.R`: My full code walkthrough of the video, with notes, examples, and data exploration.

## Purpose

This is part of my structured R learning journey after completing the Swirl R course. My goal is to reinforce my real-world R skills and prepare for report building (Quarto, Shiny) and final portfolio projects.

## Next Steps

After this, I will be:
- Building an RMarkdown or Quarto report
- Testing out a simple Shiny dashboard
- Creating and publishing a portfolio-ready R project

Feel free to explore or reuse any part of this code if you're also learning R.
